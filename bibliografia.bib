abstract = {The computing world today is in the middle of a revolution: mobile clients and cloud computing have emerged as the dominant paradigms driving programming and hardware innovation today. The Fifth Edition of Computer Architecture focuses on this dramatic shift, exploring the ways in which software and technology in the "cloud" are accessed by cell phones, tablets, laptops, and other mobile computing devices. Each chapter includes two real-world examples, one mobile and one datacenter, to illustrate this revolutionary change. Updated to cover the mobile computing revolutionEmphasizes the two most important topics in architecture today: memory hierarchy and parallelism in all its forms.Develops common themes throughout each chapter: power, performance, cost, dependability, protection, programming models, and emerging trends ("What's Next")Includes three review appendices in the printed text. Additional reference appendices are available online.Includes updated Case Studies and completely new exercises.}

abstract = {Architecture parameter exploration is one of the main analysis that needs to be performed in order to ensure that a multicore system has an optimal set of parameters. The main drawback of current simulation approaches is the long simulation times in order to extract performance metrics while varying a system parameter. Trace-driven simulation approaches allow to abstract selected components of the system under analysis by creating traces during the execution time of an application. This technique reduces the simulation time while keeping the accuracy levels. Even tough trace-driven techniques have proven to be useful, most of them are focused on mono-core systems, and some do not completely capture the behavior of multi-threaded programs. In this regard, we developed a trace-driven simulation approach based on the gem5 framework. This approach is based on a collection phase of the instructions and dependencies of a given application and two extra traces depending on the selected analysis. It allows weak and strong scaling analysis along with the possibility to perform extensive parameter exploration analysis. For weak scaling analysis simulations, we collect synchronization traces for OpenMP applications, and for strong scaling analysis, we collect task traces for OmpSs applications.}
