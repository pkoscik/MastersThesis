abstract = {The computing world today is in the middle of a revolution: mobile clients and cloud computing have emerged as the dominant paradigms driving programming and hardware innovation today. The Fifth Edition of Computer Architecture focuses on this dramatic shift, exploring the ways in which software and technology in the "cloud" are accessed by cell phones, tablets, laptops, and other mobile computing devices. Each chapter includes two real-world examples, one mobile and one datacenter, to illustrate this revolutionary change. Updated to cover the mobile computing revolutionEmphasizes the two most important topics in architecture today: memory hierarchy and parallelism in all its forms.Develops common themes throughout each chapter: power, performance, cost, dependability, protection, programming models, and emerging trends ("What's Next")Includes three review appendices in the printed text. Additional reference appendices are available online.Includes updated Case Studies and completely new exercises.}

abstract = {Architecture parameter exploration is one of the main analysis that needs to be performed in order to ensure that a multicore system has an optimal set of parameters. The main drawback of current simulation approaches is the long simulation times in order to extract performance metrics while varying a system parameter. Trace-driven simulation approaches allow to abstract selected components of the system under analysis by creating traces during the execution time of an application. This technique reduces the simulation time while keeping the accuracy levels. Even tough trace-driven techniques have proven to be useful, most of them are focused on mono-core systems, and some do not completely capture the behavior of multi-threaded programs. In this regard, we developed a trace-driven simulation approach based on the gem5 framework. This approach is based on a collection phase of the instructions and dependencies of a given application and two extra traces depending on the selected analysis. It allows weak and strong scaling analysis along with the possibility to perform extensive parameter exploration analysis. For weak scaling analysis simulations, we collect synchronization traces for OpenMP applications, and for strong scaling analysis, we collect task traces for OmpSs applications.}

abstract = {The commonly used LRU replacement policy is susceptible to thrashing for memory-intensive workloads that have a working set greater than the available cache size. For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits.We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21\%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.},

abstract = {As a cache eviction algorithm, FIFO has a lot of attractive properties, such as simplicity, speed, scalability, and flash-friendliness. The most prominent criticism of FIFO is its low efficiency (high miss ratio).In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable FIFO-based algorithm with three static queues (S3-FIFO). Evaluated on 6594 cache traces from 14 datasets, we show that S3-FIFO has lower miss ratios than state-of-the-art algorithms across traces. Moreover, S3-FIFO's efficiency is robust --- it has the lowest mean miss ratio on 10 of the 14 datasets. FIFO queues enable S3-FIFO to achieve good scalability with 6\texttimes{} higher throughput compared to optimized LRU at 16 threads.Our insight is that most objects in skewed workloads will only be accessed once in a short window, so it is critical to evict them early (also called quick demotion). The key of S3-FIFO is a small FIFO queue that filters out most objects from entering the main cache, which provides a guaranteed demotion speed and high demotion precision.},

abstract = {LRU has been the basis of cache eviction algorithms for decades, with a plethora of innovations on improving LRU's miss ratio and throughput. While it is well-known that FIFO-based eviction algorithms provide significantly better throughput and scalability, they lag behind LRU on miss ratio, thus, cache efficiency.We performed a large-scale simulation study using 5307 block and web cache workloads collected in the past two decades. We find that contrary to what common wisdom suggests, some FIFO-based algorithms, such as FIFO-Reinsertion (or CLOCK), are, in fact, more efficient (have a lower miss ratio) than LRU. Moreover, we find that qick demotion --- evicting most new objects very quickly --- is critical for cache efficiency. We show that when enhanced by qick demotion, not only can state-of-the-art algorithms be more efficient, a simple FIFO-based algorithm can outperform five complex state-of-the-art in terms of miss ratio.},
