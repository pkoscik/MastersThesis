\section{Thesis organization}
The work is divided into the following chapters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 2 covers the \textbf{basics of cache}, including a detailed description of modern \textbf{computer architecture} and design.
  \item Chapter 3 provides an in-depth review of the \textbf{state of the art} in cache memory simulators.
  \item Chapter 4 describes the implementation of the \textbf{cache model}, and its integration with the \textbf{Renode} simulation framework
  \item Chapter 5 describes the benchmarks and the test binaries, and presents their results
  \item Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and suggests \textbf{future work}
\end{itemize}
