\chapter{Conclusions}

This thesis has explored the efficacy of using trace-based approaches for evaluating CPU cache usage and performance. Several key points should be noted:

\subsubsection*{Effectiveness of trace-based evaluation}

Trace-based evaluation has been proven to be an effective solution for profiling CPU cache performance.
By utilizing trace data, it is possible to gain detailed insights into cache behavior, such as cache hits, misses, and the overall hit-to-miss ratio (HMR). This method allows
for precise analysis of how different cache configurations impact system performance, enabling the identification of bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.
For example, the data from the matrix multiplication benchmarks clearly showed how different block sizes and cache configurations affect the number of cache misses and the
efficiency of cache usage.

\subsubsection*{Impact of cache size and configuration}

The Linux kernel payload benchmark results observed and described in the section (\ref{sec:linux_boot_perf_conc}) confirm that cache size and configuration significantly impact CPU
performance. Factors such as cache size, block size, and associativity play crucial roles in determining system efficiency. Increasing the cache size generally leads to a reduction
in cache misses, which improves overall system efficiency, at the cost of more complicated hardware design. Additionally, optimizing block size and cache associativity can
further enhance performance.
